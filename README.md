# MAUI Android MainPage assignments OnResume break the app
Doing a MainPage assignment on App.xaml.cs OnResume doesn't work and "breaks the app", it's no longer possible to do any other MainPage assignments.

Steps to Try:
- Open App
- Click buttons to do Navigations/MainPage assignments (optional)
- Press Home button to put the app in background
- Open app again
  - Notice App didn't Navigate to the "background page"
- Click buttons to do Navigations/MainPage assignments (optional)
  - Notice Navigations don't work anymore
